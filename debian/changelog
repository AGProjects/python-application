python-application (2.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added subclasses function in application.python
  * Refactored logging system
    - Aligned log function signatures with those from the logging module.
      Context can no longer be provided as keyword arguments to the functions,
      it has to be provided through the extra keyword argument.
    - Provide a better exception logging function, that can be called without
      a message to just log the traceback and which also accepts the exc_info
      argument containing an exception info tuple to log a given traceback.
      This enhanced version of the exception function is also made available
      on the logging.Logger class and is fully backwards compatible.
    - Deprecated log.msg and log.err in favor of log.info and log.exception
    - Replaced log.Formatter with an enhanced version which can be customized
      to obtain a desired logging format without the need to replace it. In
      addition a mechanism to set the default formatter is provided in case
      the Formatter customization level is not enough for the application.
    - Provide the ability to capture and log python warnings. The feature is
      turned on by default but can be disabled with capture_warnings(False).
    - Provide a ContextualLogger abstract class that can be subclassed to
      implement loggers that can modify the logged messages using additional
      context that is specific to that particular logger, without the need to
      modify the formatter.
    - Rewrote LoggingFile using io.IOBase and renamed it to StandardIOLogger
    - Simplified NamedLevel and improved it to allow its name to be modified.
    - Renamed LevelClass to LevelHandler and improved it to allow defining
      new named levels by simply attaching a new NamedLevel attribute to
      log.level: log.level.FOOBAR = NamedLevel(number) which will define a
      new level named 'FOOBAR' associated with number and register it with
      the logging module. Attaching an existing level won't rename it, it
      will only create an aliased attribute on log.level
    - Added a new 'named_levels' property to log.level which will return a
      set with all the registered named levels knows to the logging system.
    - Renamed prefix to name in SyslogHandler and start_syslog arguments
  * Fixed twisted logger and modified it to use the new twisted logger API
  * Allow a log level to format as a string
  * Improved performance for limit, making it 4 times faster
  * Fixed bug in execute_once with instances that evaluate to boolean False
  * Avoid reading a configuration file twice in certain circumstances
  * Modernize code and improve PEP-8 compliance
  * Removed obsolete pycompat/pyversions files
  * Removed unnecessary .PHONY targets in debian/rules
  * Increased debian standards version to 3.9.8

    incompatible, it is to be considered an improvement.
