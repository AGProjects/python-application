This package is a collection of modules that are useful when building python
applications. Their purpose is to eliminate the need to divert resources into
implementing the small tasks that every application needs to do in order to
run succesfully and focus on the application logic itself.

The modules that the application package provides are:

1. process       - UNIX process and signal management
2. configuration - a consistent and simple interface to handle configuration 
                   files that use the window .ini format.
3. log           - a system logger that can log to stdout/stderr and/or syslog 
                   and is easy to extend.
4. debug         - for debugging memory leaks and for timing parts of the
                   application under runtime conditions.
5. util          - misclaneous useful variables, functions and classes
