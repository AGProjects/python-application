# defined in a section (or possibly more) of the configuration file.
# The data type for the attributes is taken from the _datatypes mapping
# if defined, else it is taken from the type of the default value assigned
# to the attribute. The python bool type is automatically mapped to
# datatypes.Boolean which recognizes multiple logic values like: yes/no,
# on/off, true/false, 1/0, so there is no need to define a type mapping
# for a boolean value, only to assign a True/False value to its attribute.

#
# The configuration files are read from two directories:
#  1. The directory where the application resides.
#  2. A system directory given by process.config_directory (/etc by default)
#
# The first directory is there to allow one to run an application that is
# self contained inside a directory. This directory is automatically
# determined from the application path and is not configurable.
# The second directory is useful if the application is installed and running
# from a standard path like /usr/bin. This directory is configurable using
# process.config_directory. In this example though, we do not use the system
# config directory, instead the configuration file is in the same directory
# as the example itself.

# configuration classes defined above. The functions below will search in
# the configuration file in the specified section for settings that have
# names that match the names of the class attributes. If they are found,
# their values will be interpreted using the specified data types and if
# the values are valid they will be used to overwrite the default values
# of the corresponding attributes which were defined above.
# If an attribute doesn't have a corresponding value in the configuration
# file it will keep its default value defined above. The settings in the
# configuration file that do not have a corresponding attribute in the
# configuration class we load will be ignored.
