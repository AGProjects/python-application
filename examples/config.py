# The data type for an attributes is taken from the type of the specified
# default value, or it can be declared using a ConfigSetting descriptor in
# case the type used to instantiate the attribute is just a validator.
#
# The python bool type is automatically mapped to the datatypes.Boolean
# validator which recognizes multiple logic values like: yes/no, on/off,
# true/false, 1/0, so there is no need to use a ConfigSetting descriptor
# for a boolean value, only to assign a True/False value to its attribute.

# Read the settings from the configuration file into the attributes of our
# configuration classes. The read function takes a configuration file name
# and a section name (or an iterable that returns multiple section names
# in which case they will be read in the order that the iterable returns
# them). Internally the ConfigSection will create a ConfigFile instance
# using the provided filename. The file is searched in both the system
# and the local config directories and the files which are present will be
# loaded in this order. This means that a local config file will overwrite
# settings from the system config file if both are present.
# The config directories are configurable on the process instance available
# from application.process.process, as process.system_config_directory and
# process.local_config_directory. By default the system config directory
# defaults to /etc and the local config directory defaults to the path from
# where the script is run, thus allowing applications to run from inside a
# directory without any other dependencies. In this example the config file
# will be read from ./config.ini which is in the local config directory.
#
# While reading the section, only settings that are defined on the config
# class wil be considered. Those present in the section that do not have a
# correspondent in the class attributes will be ignored, while the class
# attributes for which there are no settings in the section will remain
# unchanged.
