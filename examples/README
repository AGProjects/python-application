This directory holds some examples of using python-application. 

1. process.py - Example of using the process module to control how the
                application runs (foreground or background) and how it
                handles operating system signals. This example also shows
                how to set other process attributes (like the runtime
                directory) and how to use the log module for logging.

2. config.py  - Example of how to handle the application configuration file.

3. debug.py   - Example of using the debugging facilities. Timing code
                execution and finding memory leaks are shown here.

4. singleton.py - Example that shows how to use the Singleton metaclass
                  to create singletons.

5. notification.py - Example that shows how to use the notification system.

To run the examples without installing python-application, run the
following command prior to trying the examples:

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/python-application
